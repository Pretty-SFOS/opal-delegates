# Changelog

## 3.1.0 (2024-09-07)

- Added a new `alignment` property to `DelegateInfoItem`. It is now possible to
  change the text alignment of info items. They are still horizontally centered
  by default.
- Fixed documentation of default property values

## 3.0.0 (2024-06-29)

- Completely refactored API, style, and internal workings
- Changed main branch name from `master` to `main`
- Added full documentation
- Updated example gallery
- First public release

Note: API changes are not listed here because the previous versions have not
been included in Opal releases. However, porting should be easy by copying
examples from the [`doc/gallery.qml`](doc/gallery.qml) file and by following
the documentation.

## 2.0.0 (2024-06-18)

- Relicensed under GPL-3.0-or-later

## 1.0.0 (2023-06-17)
